# Evaluating LangChain with BeyondLLM

## Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the capabilities of **LangChain** by integrating it with **BeyondLLM**. The primary goal is to enhance the document retrieval and question-answering process through the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By leveraging BeyondLLM's evaluation metrics, the project aims to ensure that the responses generated by LangChain are contextually relevant, coherent, and grounded in the retrieved information.

## Key Features

- **Integration of BeyondLLM**: Utilize BeyondLLM to assess the quality of outputs generated by LangChain, providing insights into the relevancy and accuracy of responses.
  
- **Document Processing**: Load and process PDF documents, splitting them into manageable chunks for efficient analysis and retrieval.

- **Embedding Generation**: Create high-quality embeddings for document chunks, enabling effective similarity searches and improving the relevance of retrieved information.

- **Vector Store Implementation**: Implement a vector store to facilitate fast and efficient similarity searches, ensuring that the most relevant documents are retrieved based on user queries.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Employ a RAG approach to combine the strengths of information retrieval and language generation, resulting in more informative and context-aware answers.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Leverage BeyondLLM's utilities to evaluate context relevancy, answer relevancy, and groundedness of generated responses, ensuring high standards of quality.

## Use Cases

This project can be applied in various scenarios, including:

- **Customer Support**: Automate responses to frequently asked questions by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
- **Research Assistance**: Help researchers quickly find and summarize information from large volumes of academic papers.
- **Content Management**: Enable organizations to efficiently manage and retrieve information from internal documents and reports.

## Conclusion

By integrating BeyondLLM with LangChain, this project demonstrates a robust approach to evaluating and enhancing AI applications focused on document retrieval and question answering. The combination of these technologies provides a significant improvement over traditional methods, making it a valuable tool for various applications in information retrieval.
